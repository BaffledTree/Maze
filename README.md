##Summary

  Labrynthia generates random mazes for you to solve! You can create an account and save your favorite mazes to play with later. Labrynthia constructs randomly generated mazes using a combination of graph theory, recursive backtracking, and Object Oriented JavaScript following the Model, View, Controller (MVC) pattern. 

  This project is meant to demonstrate my ability to grasp object oriented JavaScript and understanding of how to create a full-stack web application. 

  Note: This was copied from a private repository (from school), so many of the commits are not logged. The original repository only contained rules and goals for the final project.

##How it works

  Users can create an account or login in order to play the maze game. Once a user has logged in, they can solve the maze by moving their arrow keys. 

  Users can generate a random maze by clicking on the "New Maze" button and save their favorite mazes by clickin on the "Save Maze" button. 

  To view saved mazes, click on "My Mazes" to see a list of your favorite maze!
