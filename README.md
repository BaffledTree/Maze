##Learning Compentencies

##Summary

  Labrynthia generates random mazes for you to solve! You can create an account and save your favorite mazes to play with later. Labrynthia constructs randomly generated mazes using a combination of graph theory, recursive backtracking, and Object Oriented JavaScript following the Model, View, Controller (MVC) pattern. 

  Note: This was copied from a private repository (from school), so many of the commits are not logged. The original repository only contained rules and goals for the final project.
